A culture of innovation and the opportunity to work with some of the smartest people from around the world.\n\n3. Private space to work distraction-free, with freedom over your personal choices.\n\n4. Better civic sense, law, and order.\n\n5. Financial benefit\u2014especially when visiting India, where the exchange rate multiplies your money by 80.\n\nCONS\n\n1. Visa issues create constant stress. It took 14 years for me to get my green card due to the backlog for India.\n\n2. Poor food quality. Vegetables and other ingredients lack their original taste. Eating stale, frozen food is common.\n\n3. Social isolation, which can be stressful, especially during sickness or challenges.\n\n4. Lack of thrill. Life feels predictable, like a for-loop: Weekdays\u2014work, kids' classes, walk, sleep. Weekends\u2014Costco/Patel brother visits, cleaning, birthday parties, temple visits. While this may be true in India as well, in the USA it is extreme.\n\n5. No concept of bai (maid). You are your own Ramukaka and Shantabai \ud83e\udd23\n\nUltimately, happiness is very subjective. It depends on your personality, goals, and experiences. Some people are happy and content, while others regret not moving back.\n\nHow has your experience in the USA been so far?",

It took 6 years, but the channel grew, giving me the confidence to quit. Online passive teaching = time + location independence.\n\n2) Developed a software and AI services business AtliQ Technologies with my brother. He handled operations while I provided mentorship and funding. After 6 years, we became profitable and now it is going great.\n\n3) Built relationships with like-minded individuals who shared my life, business, and spiritual values, making them partners in my entrepreneurial journey. Shoutout to Bhavin Patel Hemanand Vadivel Karandeep Singh Grover Pranav Trivedi\n\n4) Throughout my career, I treated my time like a precious treasure, skipping time-wasters like binge-watching TV, pointless chats, unnecessary social events, and online deal hunting. Instead, I used that time to learn something new daily, fueling the growth of Codebasics and AtliQ Technologies.\n\nComing from a middle-class village family in India with no business background, this journey was unique.\n\nThis post isn't to boast but to show that with dedication and discipline, achieving freedom is possible.\n\nThe world is full of opportunities; the key is to BEGIN and PERSIST \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc",

He would pay a small capital gains. And, live with the rest.\n\nThis 25% tax increase for someone like him has killed his retirement plans. And, he is now looking to get back to the workforce.\n\nMore importantly he is now worried that this number will not be at 12.5%, it will eventually go to 30%, some day.\n\nPoint is: you might plan for retirement today on excel.\nBut, random taxation will kill it.\n\nWe all worry about 10-12% returns on our portfolio or a 10% hike on salary.\nBut, ignore such big developments.\n\nSolution:\n1) Be invested across different asset class\n2) Learn about taxation\n3) And, at some stage in your career (when you have a big portfolio), be tax optimised.\n\nTaxations are going in 1 direction.\nAnd, we all know which one",

        "text": "Live in India vs go abroad? Let me share my practical insights on the same.\n\n[1] For starters, I have actually lived across multiple countries.\n\n[2] Practically going through the journey of building startups. And, working in corporates, here is what I would tell you:-\n\n- India has one of the worst corporate cultures.\n- The labour is plenty and jobs are few. This asymmetry give massive power to people in higher positions.\n- For 60% the pay, you have to put 150% the work: if you compare it to most of the developed markets: like Singapore, Dubai, Europe etc.\n\n[3] Racism is real if you work abroad. You are in a foreign land. You chose to migrate there. Don't expect equitable treatment.\n\nThe world is unfair, get used to it. Your looks, the way you communicate, your connections-- everything matters.\n\n[4] Despite this: there are numerous opportunities to save money, make more switch, grow in career.\n\nThere are certain types of jobs (eg. front end investment banking) are very hard to come in India, compared to other locations.\n\n[5] Office politics is everywhere: Indian/abroad it does not matter. Be skilled, if bootlicking is not your thing.\n\n[6] It is a myth: that once you go abroad it is very difficult to find jobs back in India then (maybe for some industries). But, generally: once you have global experiences (and if you are an Indian by passport), finding a job is not an uphill battle.\n\nYes, if you are trying to get equal salary etc. then of course, that is unlikely to happen.\n\n[7] If you are abroad: you get access to more investable investment options. A classic case study is FDs in India. After tax you get 4.5-5% these days, inflation is close to 4-6%. So basically you lose money in FDs in India.\n\nMany locations like Dubai: FD rates are 4.5-5.5% after tax. Inflation is 2-3%. You actually make money on FDs\n\nWe can go onto talk about Cryptos, Bonds etc.\nTo cut the long-story short: wealth building outside India is much easier.\n\n[8] If you are used to the chaos in India, you would love the organised work environment most countries: eg. Singapore etc offers.\n\nThis would be a very different type of an experience, which can't be explained in words.\n\nSome would like it, some might not.\n\n[9] If you wish to start something: should you be in India or abroad? depends on what precisely you are starting.\n\nIf you are starting an NBFC firm, you have to be in India (if your target audience is Indian). If you are running a D2C startup, which sources from China and sells in India, you don't need to be in India.\n\nYou need to take such nuanced view.\n\n[10] In an uncertain world: diversification is a good hedge. Applies to investing, career and life building.",
